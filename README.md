# KBMK-GUI
User Interface for a KB-makro.

This User Interface can create .kb files, which can then be used by the kb-makro. The GUI should help you specify keys and place them as you like.

## Installation 
There is no installation file or similar. Currently there is only a binary file in /bin/Debug.

## Build
The project is built in codeblocks with gtk+ 2.0 .

## Future plans
I would like to be able to merge the two project so that you can install one application and create as well as use the makros.
